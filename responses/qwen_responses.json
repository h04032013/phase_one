        "response": "[\\INST] Provide insightful explanations to grade-school students for these math questions\nHow many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have? [\\INST] To determine the number of vertical asymptotes for the function \\( y = \\frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \\), we need to identify the values of \\( x \\) that make the denominator zero, as these are the points where the function is undefined and potentially has vertical asymptotes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the denominator:**\n   The denominator of the function is \\( x^2 + x - 6 \\).\n\n2. **Factor the denominator:**\n   To factor \\( x^2 + x - 6 \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\(-6\\) (the constant term) and add up to \\(1\\) (the coefficient of the linear term). These numbers are \\(3\\) and \\(-2\\).\n\n   Therefore, we can factor the quadratic expression as:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + x - 6 = (x + 3)(x - 2)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set the denominator equal to zero:**\n   To find the values of \\( x \\) that make the denominator zero, we set the factored form equal to zero:\n   \\[\n   (x + 3)(x - 2) = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x + 3 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x - 2 = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = -3 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = 2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the vertical asymptotes:**\n   The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero and the numerator is non-zero. From our factorization, we see that the denominator is zero at \\( x = -3 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points.\n\n   The numerator of the function is \\( 2 \\), which is a constant and is never zero. Therefore, the numerator is non-zero at both \\( x = -3 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   The vertical asymptotes occur at \\( x = -3 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe graph of \\( y = \\frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \\) has \\(\\boxed{2}\\) vertical asymptotes."

The \\(n\\)-th term can be written as:\n\n\\[ a_n = \\frac{n+1}{n+2} \\]\n\nWe need to find the product of the first 20 terms, so we need to compute:\n\n\\[ \\prod_{n=1}^{20} \\frac{n+1}{n+2} \\]\n\nThis can be written as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot \\frac{21}{22} \\cdot \\frac{22}{23} \\]\n\nNotice that this is a telescoping product. In a telescoping product, most terms in the numerator and the denominator cancel out. Specifically, the numerator of each fraction cancels with the denominator of the next fraction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot \\frac{21}{22} \\cdot \\frac{22}{23} = \\frac{2}{23} \\]\n\nThus, the product of the first 20 terms of the sequence is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{2}{23}} \\]"
