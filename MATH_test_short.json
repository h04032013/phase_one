    "problem": "John and Gary are playing a game. John spins a spinner numbered with integers from 1 to 20. Gary then writes a list of all of the positive factors of the number spun except for the number itself. Gary then creates a new spinner with all of the numbers on his list. John then spins this spinner, and the process continues. The game is over when the spinner has no numbers on it.

    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If John spins a 20, then Gary's list contains the numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 10. Thus, these are the numbers on the second spinner.\n\nIf John spins a 1, then Gary's list will be empty because there are no positive factors of 1 besides itself. Thus, the game will be over. This yields a maximum of 1 additional spin.\n\nIf John spins a 2, then Gary's list will only contain the number 1. Then on John's next spin, we will have the same scenario as above. This yields a maximum of 2 additional spins.\n\nIf John spins a 4, then Gary's list will contain the numbers 1 and 2. As we have already found above, spinning a 2 yields more additional spins than a 1, so the maximum additional spins in this case is 3 spins.\n\nIf John spins a 5, then Gary's list will only contain the number 1. As above, this will yield a maximum of 2 additional spins.\n\nFinally, if John spins a 10, then Gary's list will contain the numbers 1, 2, and 5. Of these numbers, 2 and 5 have the highest maximum number of additional spins, so this case has a maximum of 3 additional spins.\n\nThus, of all of the possibilities, spinning a 4 or 10 next could result in 3 additional spins, so the maximum total number of spins is $\\boxed{4}$.

The ten element directly expands to $10D_{n-1}$. The three element expands to 3 times the determinant of the the matrix formed from omitting the second column and first row from the original matrix. Call this matrix $X_{n}$. $X_{n}$ has a first column entirely of zeros except for the first element, which is a three. A property of matrices is that the determinant can be expanded over the rows instead of the columns (still using the recursive definition as given in the problem), and the determinant found will still be the same. Thus, expanding over this first column yields $3D_{n-2} + 0=3D_{n-2}$. Thus, the $3\\det(X_{n})$ expression turns into $9D_{n-2}$. Thus, the equation $D_{n}=10D_{n-1}-9D_{n-2}$ holds for all $n > 2$.\n\nThis equation can be rewritten as $D_{n}=10(D_{n-1}-D_{n-2}) + D_{n-2}$. This version of the equation involves the difference of successive terms of a recursive sequence. Calculating $D_{0}$ backwards from the recursive formula and $D_{4}$ from the formula yields $D_{0}=1, D_{4}=7381$. Examining the differences between successive terms, a pattern emerges.  $D_{0}=1=9^{0}$, $D_{1}-D_{0}=10-1=9=9^{1}$, $D_{2}-D_{1}=91-10=81=9^{2}$, $D_{3}-D_{2}=820-91=729=9^{3}$, and $D_{4}-D_{3}=7381-820=6561=9^{4}$.

    "solution": "Since the slope of the line is $\\frac{2}{5},$ the line rises 2 units vertically for every 5 horizontal units.  Thus, a possible direction vector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}.$\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\n\npair A, B, C;\n\nA = (0,0);\nB = (5,0);\nC = (5,2);\n\ndraw(A--B--C);\ndraw(A--C,red,Arrow(6));\n\nlabel(\"$5$\", (A + B)/2, S);\nlabel(\"$2$\", (B + C)/2, E);\n[/asy]\n\nThis means any nonzero scalar multiple of $\\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$ is a possible direction vector.  The possible options are then $\\boxed{\\text{B, E, G}}.$",
